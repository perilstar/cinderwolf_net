## Hi!

I'm Erica, but I also go by other usernames like Cinder and perilstar. Note: there are other people that use some of the same usernames, they're not all me!

Here are a few of my projects that I like.

### Raycaster

Originally I created this project in Scratch as a challenge for myself. Then I decided I wanted to add new featues to it and make it more performant, so I re-wrote it in JavaScript. It uses the CPU only in a single thread to do all the rendering, and then throws the result to the GPU for a CRT post-processing shader. Be warned: The code is messy and uncommented as I ported it at a time I already had forgotten what the Scratch code did.

### Virtual Bubble Wrap

We all get stressed out sometimes. Luckily, I've got a scientifically proven cure for anxiety right here, on this webpage.

### Easing Function Generator

I wanted a bezier curve easing function generator that output JavaScript code. So I made one!
